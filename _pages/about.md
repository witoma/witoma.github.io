Welcome. My qualifications include a PhD from University of Birmingham, UK and two degrees in Computer Science and Sports Science.

With expertise in sports biomechanics, exercise physiology, wearable teachnology, modelling and coding, my research aims to discover the mechanisms that operate the relationship between sports technology, biomechanics, physiology and sports performance. My applied work aims to create ways to improve practice. I have [published](/publications/) almost 50 scientific papers. By leveraging knowledge and industry expertise I aim to create solutions that can be applied in the real-world environment. I am particularly excited about working with effective teams and individuals in the sports performance industry.  

I am currently a [consultant](/consultancy/) in a range of elite team sports, an applied sports scientist and a developer at [SpeedSig](https://www.speedsignature.com/). In addition, I am developing several projects (check the [projects page](/projects/)) and I am a visiting research fellow at [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/). Previously I was a lecturer and research fellow at University of Queensland.  

Originally from England, I studied and worked in Manchester and Birmingham. I am now based in Brisbane, Australia. Please feel free to explore the site and contact me if you would like to discuss ideas or collaborations on these or other projects.
