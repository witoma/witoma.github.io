Welcome. I hold a PhD from University of Birmingham, UK and I am passionate about working with effective teams and individuals in sports performance. With expertise in sports biomechanics, exercise physiology, wearable teachnology, modelling and coding, my research aims to discover the mechanisms that operate the relationship between sports technology, biomechanics, physiology and sports performance. By leveraging knowledge and industry expertise I create solutions that can be applied in the real-world environment.  

Originally from England, I studied and worked in Manchester and Birmingham. I am now based in Brisbane, Australia.  

I am currently a consultant in a range of elite team sports, a sports science consultant and developer at SpeedSig, I am developing several personal projects (check the [projects page](/projects/)) I am also a visiting research fellow at Queensland University of Technology. Previously I was a lecturer and reearch fellow at University of Queensland.  

Please feel free to explore the site and contact me if you would like to discuss ideas or collaborations on these or other projects.
