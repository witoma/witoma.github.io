Welcome. I hold a PhD from University of Birmingham, UK and I am passionate about working with effective teams and leveraging knowledge and industry expertise to create high throughput products.

Originally from England, I studied and worked in Manchester and Birmingham, and I am now based in Brisbane, Australia.

I am currently a consultant to several clubs in elite team sport, a sports science consultant at SpeedSig, and I am a visiting research fellow at Queensland University of Technology. Previously I was an academic at University of Queensland.

I am developing a number of personal projects which are linked above. Please feel free to explore and contact me if you want to discuss ideas or collaborations on these or other projects.
