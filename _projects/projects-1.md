*What is Shoe Lab?*  

Shoe lab is a tool that allows you to estimate the direct effect of running footwear on running economy (RE).  
<br>

*What is RE?*  

RE is a key determinant of distance running performance and is defined as the energy cost to move the centre of mass (COM) at a given race pace. A more economical runner uses smaller energy.  


*Is footwear important for RE?*  


Yes!  


The effect of footwear on RE and therefore performance has changed over the last decade. Traditional footwear technologies (TFTs), comprising shoes available prior to 2016, were not considered to have significant effects on RE. However, available since 2017, Advanced Footwear Technologies (AFTs) are known to significantly improve RE and have revolutionized competitive distance running, being used in world record breaking performances across a range of distances from 5k up to the Marathon.  


*What is the mechanism between footwear and RE?*  


AFTs differ from TFTs in several important ways, the key ones being they have thicker and more resilient midsoles, and they typically contain a curved carbon fiber plate. Both midsole properties and carbon fiber plates can improve RE.  


Midsole properties can inherently affect the foams capacity to act as a spring. The midsole can therefore reduce the cost of cushioning the COM at foot contact and it can increase the energy return during the propulsive phase of ground contact. Both of these are deemed to directly affect COM energetics.  


A carbon fiber plate increases the longitudinal bending stiffness of footwear which reduces the energy lost at the ankle and foot â€“ especially at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. However, a stiffer carbon fiber plate is not always optimal. Studies indicate an optimal stiffness exists for each person based on individual body size and biomechanics. Carbon fiber plates are therefore linked to changes to mechanical energy at the ankle and foot which indirectly affects COM energetics.  


The precise biomechanical mechanism between footwear properties and RE have not been identified. However, to quantify the mediating effect of biomechanics first requires a theoretical model which can differentiate between the direct effect of footwear and the indirect effect of biomechanics. Figure 1 shows such a model.
