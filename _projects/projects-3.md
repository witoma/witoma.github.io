*What is Run Speed?*  

Run Speed allows runners to monitor their training volume, speed and their responses to training. The <a href="https://runspeed.shinyapps.io/coach/" target="_blank">Run Speed</a> app can be found <a href="https://runspeed.shinyapps.io/coach/" target="_blank">here</a>.

*What is the scientific basis for Run Speed?*  

In other systems, training load, which is a combined measure of volume and intensity, is typically used to ESTIMATE whether their training is having the desired effect on fatigue, fitness and performance.

Run Speed works in a different way by monitoring volume (distance) and speed individually along with a *novel measure of training response*. Together, these variables allow runners to MEASURE the extent to which their training prescription is having a desired effect.

*What are the benefits of using Run Speed?*  

Run Speed provides feedback to runners on whether they are responding and adapting to a training program in the intended way. For example, the impact of intense training and races on subsequent training sessions can be quantified.


*How do I sign up to Run Speed?*  

Note that at the moment Run Speed is set up for Garmin users only and requires heart rate data. Best results are obtained from using a chest strap when measuring heart rate.

Run Speed is currently free to use. If you are a Garmin user and want to try it out please go to the <a href="https://runspeed.shinyapps.io/coach/" target="_blank">Run Speed</a> app, click "Create Account" and fill in the requested details.
