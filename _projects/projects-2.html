<b>What is Track Lap?</b>
<br>
<br>
Track Lap uses race split times to model sprint race performance. Track Lap estimates the following data:
<br>
<br>
&#x2022 Continuous velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Time to peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Distance to peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Duration of the deceleraton phase
<br>
&#x2022 Magnitude of acceleration
<br>
&#x2022 Magnitude of deceleration
<br>
<br>

We provide videos and race reports of races from which split times are validated.
