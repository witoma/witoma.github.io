<b>What is Track Lap?</b>
<br>
<br>
Track Lap is a performance modelling system for elite track sprinting. Track lap uses split times to model the race and extract the following from 100m, 200m, and 400m races:
<br>
<br>
&#x2022 Continuous velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Time to peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Distance to peak velocity
<br>
&#x2022 Duration of the deceleraton phase
<br>
&#x2022 Duration of the deceleraton phase
<br>
&#x2022 Magnitude of acceleration
<br>
&#x2022 Magnitude of the deceleration
<br>
<br>

We provide videos and race reports of races from which split times are validated.
