*What is Empower?*  


Empower is a two-year, co-designed, data-driven initiative that brings together Queenslanders with Disability Network (QDN), Jamieson Trauma Institute, Metro North Health, QUT, UQ and Griffith University to strengthen inclusion and increase participation of people with disability in sport, recreation and physical activity across Queensland.

Funded by the Department of Sport, Racing, and Olympic and Paralympic Games, Empower will map current participation, identify barriers and opportunities, and integrate existing and newly collected data into a spatial mapping platform that highlights opportunities for people with disability across the state.

Guided by lived experience, strong community engagement and alignment with Elevate 2042, Empower provides the foundation for long-term, evidence-based planning and investment, supporting Queensland’s commitment to expand inclusive participation and deliver a meaningful legacy for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
